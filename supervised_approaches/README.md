# Sequence-to-Sequence

This directory contains our implementation of a seq2seq model.
We use this as a proof of concept, and in the future, as a guide for incorporating seq2seq within the NNPDA.

The `seq2seq.py` model followed an online guide, and the `s2s.py` file is our work in augmenting the guide for our purposes.

### Execution
This file can be run with 
```
python main.py
```

### Output
The output of running the our Seq2seq model can be found in the `output_files` directory.
Specifically `output_files/seq2seq_out.txt`.
